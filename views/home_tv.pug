        p.white_text
          | Our aim is to provide a simple way to generate TV recommendations tailored to each individual user. Everyone has at spent at least an evening or two scrolling through different TV shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime not knowing what to watch. We want to make this as easy as possible.   
        p.white_text
          | All we ask is for you to rate five of your favorite TV shows. That's it! Once you do this, there'll be a personal list of shows tailored just for you. As with anything, the more you rate, the more accurate we get. We also know that not everyone is a fan of every type of show. If you give us an idea of what you don't like, we'll take this into consideration too! üçø

        p.white_text
          | We use the&nbsp; #[a(href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction" target="_blank") TMDB API] to get our data on millions of movies. It's one of the worlds largest movie and TV databases that gives us access to an unreal amount of content.
        p.white_text
          | We also use&nbsp; #[a(href="https://www.justwatch.com/" target="_blank") JustWatch] help us with our data around watch providers. They provide the ability, through TMDB, to get the watch providers for streaming, renting and buying for many many countries.
        p.white_text
          | Combining this API with information given from you we can calculate the movies we think you would like. The calculations used are constantly evolving and so we are always looking for feedback on how well it works.
        p.white_text  
          | We are also conscious that when signing up no one wants to spend half their evening rating movies. This is why we start gives recommendations after only rating 5 movies.
        p.white_text  
          | We have a lot of people to thank for some of the content we use, no more so than TMDB but also a lot of the content creators over on #[a(href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank") Unsplash].
